## Dependencies

This project was made possible thanks to the work of many talents on the following projects:
* [StereoKit](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit/tree/cb6717aa8bc853e039bf3e0751cf4bff24c94910?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies) which itself is based on valuable projects.
* [rust_mobile](https://github.com/rust-mobile) used for the android specific code.
* [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) used for cross-platform management. 
* [openxrs](https://github.com/Ralith/openxrs) nice binding of OpenXR.
* [blender](https://www.blender.org/) for gltf files, HDRI, models and demo animations
* [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for icons files.
* bitflags.
* android_logger.
* this_error & anyerror.
* ... many others, more discreet, without which nothing would be possible.
